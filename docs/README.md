### Expert Interviews

The `additional` directory contains structured interviews with two NBG experts using identical questionnaires:

- `Questions_to_NBG - 1.docx` - First expert responses

## Research Foundation

These documents established the theoretical and regulatory foundation for the implementation in the `IncomeEstimation` directory by:

- Defining specific regulatory thresholds that guided model development
- Informing the design of regulatory-aware loss functions
- Establishing appropriate evaluation metrics for compliance
- Providing business context for the research findings

All code implementations align with the regulatory requirements and insights gathered from these documents.
